## Idea
A module in SAFE that allows role management for DAOs. That's it. 

### Use Case Idea
Imagine you're a company and you go to a hackathon and you set up a safe so that you can give mainnet token to exhausted hackers. Maybe you want to set some rules about that, so that not everybody who's an owner of the big safe can actually execute transactions?
